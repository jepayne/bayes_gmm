Notes on the data set and notations:

- when we use t as an argument, we include the first lag_obs_factor many
- len_history includes the first lag_obs_factor many observations, so it is NOT equal to the number of g
=> len_history can be initialized as data->ncol()
- both the moments and the gmm instance have the data (with inactive initial elements)
- the number of g_t (i.e. the number of terms in the sum) is (len_history - lag_obs_factor)
